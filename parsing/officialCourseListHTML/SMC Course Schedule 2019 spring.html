</div><h2>Anthropology</h2><p>Anthropology is a diverse discipline involving the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences that examines various aspects of past and present-day humans. It consists of four fields: Archaeology, Cultural Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Physical Anthropology. Archaeology examines past human cultures through material culture. Cultural Anthropology focuses on sociocultural variation among humans. Linguistic Anthropology examines how language influences society and culture. Physical Anthropology studies the biological and behavioral aspects of humans within an evolutionary framework.</p><div id="ANTHRO-1" tabindex="-1">

<p>This course presents a cross-cultural survey of the position of men and women within an anthropological framework.  It assesses, in a comparative fashion, the biological basis of sexual differentiation and the cultural interpretation of these differences through "gender roles."  Comparative materials from tribal, non-western, non-industrial, and western cultures will be used to illustrate the variety of gender roles and expectations.  The course focuses on cultural institutions as fundamental in creating, defining, and reinforcing gender roles.  Economics, politics, the arts, ethnicity, race, religion, kinship, world view, language, and other issues which influence choices, opportunities and limitations tied to gender will be examined.</p>

<p>This course will introduce students to the historical and cultural use of power by peoples and cultures in Latin America.  We will investigate the use of power of Latin American peoples and cultures who lived prior to contact with Europeans, in colonial and post-colonial culture in Latin America, as well as in contemporary Latin American society.  The investigation of the power of the US/Mexican border and of globalization within Latin America will also be covered in this course.  A cross-cultural perspective will be employed drawing from examples in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and from the influence of countries outside of Latin America including the United States, England, France, Portugal, Spain, China, and Japan.  Power relations included in the notions of race, class, gender and sexuality, immigration and migration, and indigenism (amongst others), as they are practiced in Latin America, are explored throughout the semester.</p>

<h3>ART 20C, Digital Drawing <span></span>3 units</h3>
<p class="preface">Transfer:  UC, CSU
</p><p class="preface">Advisory:  Art 10C.</p>
<p>This course is designed for students who are interested in broadening their range of drawing options by integrating traditional fine art drawing skills with digital technologies. Focus will be on exploration of the principles of drawing in their simplest form: marks, lines, shapes, light, perspective, proportion and spatial relationships. Using a combination of vector based and digital imaging software applications combined with traditional hands-on techniques, students will create drawing projects on the computer, as well as maintain a notebook of hands-on sketches. This course is a continuation of the compositional theories and skills developed in fundamental drawing classes, with an emphasis on preparing students to build upon their digital skills and fine art concepts and to develop personal directions in drawing.</p>

</div><h2>Biological Sciences</h2><p>Coursework and study in the biological sciences provides a foundation for future employment in many of the fastest growing and emerging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields today. Students of biology are at the front lines of many of the most critical questions our society is facing in the 21st century and beyond, including addressing climate change, the biodiversity crisis, resource management and population growth, emerging/infectious diseases and public health. Students of biology become lab technicians, nurses, genetic counselors, physicians, environmental scientists, landscape architects, state and national park rangers, researchers in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, teachers and college professors. Logic and critical thinking skills developed as a student of biology are applicable to nearly every field and every discipline and provide a foundation for making informed personal, business and public policy decisions.

Students must be present for the first session of biological science classes to be assured of admission to limited laboratory spaces. Students who wish to enroll in a Life Sciences course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment.  Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better.  If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better.  Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.</p><div id="ANATMY-1" tabindex="-1">

<p>This course is an intensive study of the gross and microscopic structure of the human body including the four major types of tissue and their subgroups, and the following organ systems: integumentary, skeletal, muscular, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory.  Functions of the organ systems are included at the introductory level to prepare students for a course in Human Physiology.  Laboratory assignments develop the skills of observation, investigation, identification, discovery and dissection.  The use of actual specimens, including cat dissection and observation of a human cadaver, is emphasized to assure that students learn the relative structure, functions, textures and variations in tissues not incorporated in models.  Supplemental materials such as models, photographs, charts, videotapes, and digitized images are also provided.  This course is required for students preparing for many Allied Health professions including, but not limited to, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physical Education and Kinesiology Training, and Physician's Assistant and is a prerequisite for Human Physiology 3.</p>

<p>The evolution of American food culture is examined from a historical, contemporary, economic, political and scientific survey of ethnic groups in America, including Native Americans, European Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Immigration, enculturation, acculturation, religion, food availability, food preference, food behavior, food preparation, food beliefs and food-related gender roles are considered. These factors are compared and contrasted across the ethnic groups and regions in America. The impact of "Americanization" on ethnic cuisines and impact of ethnic cuisines on the American economy are explored. Current research on the health- and nutrition-related implications of ethnic groups' food choices/practices is reviewed. Engendering cultural sensitivity and competency is at the core of this course.</p>

</div><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Chemists study the properties of matter and make qualitative and quantitative analysis of many substances. They conduct a variety of experiments and tests in laboratories to develop new knowledge or maintain control over the quality of existing products and procedures. Chemists may work in research and development, or production and quality control in the chemical manufacturing industry, and in education or government institutions.

Students must be present at the first lab session of a chemistry course to be assured of admission to limited lab spaces.
Students who wish to enroll in a chemistry course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment.  Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better.  If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better.  Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.</p><div id="CHEM-9" tabindex="-1">

</div><h2>Communication Studies</h2><p>Communication Studies offers students courses that combine theory and application in many areas of the discipline. These courses encourage our students to apply conceptual material to daily interactions in a variety of communication contexts.  In addition, our discipline provides a wide range of course offerings in the Communication Studies major.  Oral Communication focuses on the skills and knowledge needed for creating effective and appropriate public communication skills. Courses include public speaking, oral interpretation of literature, persuasion, group communication, argumentation, and competitive speech and debate. Students completing courses in oral communication gain practical skills in researching, developing and presenting ideas and arguments in a variety of contexts preparing them for upper division, workplace, and personal presentations.  Communication Theory focuses on human communication theory, especially as it relates to the interpersonal and/or group levels of communication. Courses in this area include interpersonal, group communication, intercultural communication, gender and communication, communication theory and research methodologies. Students completing courses in the communication theory area learn theoretical knowledge to prepare them for transfer into communication studies programs at the university and practical communication skills to improve their own interpersonal effectiveness.</p><div id="COM-ST-9" tabindex="-1">

</p><h2>Cosmetology</h2><p>Cosmetology is a career technical all-inclusive program that prepares students for a wide range of careers within the beauty industry. The curriculum offers a theoretical and practical component along with a hands-on approach to learning that includes up-
to-date interactive demonstrations and training on clients in a salon setting. This prepares the students to possess the knowledge and skills for career opportunities in the beauty industry such as haircutting, hairstyling, colorist, chemical specialist, skin and nail spas, sales and entrepreneurship. Students are coached in the importance of professionalism and creativity in an experiential learning environment with motivated faculty. Upon completion of the courses, students are prepared to take and pass the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology exam to become a licensed cosmetologist, esthetician or manicurist. Courses may lead to an associate degree in cosmetology and/or a certificate of achievement. Students may attend the programs on a full or part time basis.</p><div id="COSM-10A" tabindex="-1">

<h2>Esl - English As A Second Language</h2>
<p>English for Second Language Speakers courses are designed specifically for students whose first language is not English.  SMC offers three different ESL programs:  
1) Credit ESL courses focus on academic skills needed for success in college (reading textbooks, listening and notetaking, writing papers with citations, speaking in class in small groups, and making presentations).  Faculty assist students in the development of grammar, vocabulary, paraphrasing, and summarizing skills within the context of themes or academic content.  ESL 11B, 21A, and 21B are CSU and UC transferable (up to 8 units).   
2) Noncredit ESL courses focus on college and career readiness and developing the skills needed for life and work in the US.  Noncredit ESL courses are free to students, except those studying on an F-1 visa.  These courses do not carry any academic credit.
3) Intensive ESL (offered through SMC's Community Services Program in conjunction with International Education) offers multi-skills courses to prepare international students for entry to Santa Monica College.  Student work is graded, but courses in the Intensive ESL Program do not receive academic credit.  These courses are offered for a fee.</p>

</div><h2>Fashion Design and Merchandising</h2><p>Fashion design students develop skills in design communication, including preliminary sketching, technical flat sketching, illustration, and usage of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and CAD software. Skills in draping, pattern drafting from draping and body measurements, and basic sewing skills to advanced construction are developed in order to create sample garments for production and sales.

Fashion merchandisers select, purchase, promote, and sell clothing and accessories. They study fashion trends and visit manufacturers and merchandise markets. They work as part of a team and consult with managers and buyers,
advise the advertising and display departments, and organize and coordinate promotional activities such as fashion shows. They may advance to become buyers and purchasing agents, sales representatives, and managers. Clothes designers create new apparel and accessory designs. They may sketch the garment, cut the pattern, select the fabric and materials, and in some cases construct the sample garment. They may arrange for the showing of a line at sales meetings or fashion shows.</p><div id="FASHN-1" tabindex="-1">

</div><h2>Film Studies</h2><p>Film consists of two areas of concentration: Film Studies and Film Production.  Film Studies introduces students to the history and development of cinema/film as an art, an object of philosophical study, and a cultural and social phenomenon. Students examine the theoretical approaches and trends in filmmaking including the contemporary evolution from film to digital media. 

Film Production provides practical as well as theoretical training in screenwriting, directing, creative producing, cinematography, sound recording, production design, and below-the-line crafts (gaffers, grips, operators, assistants). Students learn all aspects of film production from an academic discipline to hands-on experience that prepares them to earn an Associate degree and/or certificate of achievement in film production; for upper division study at a four-year college or advanced film school; and/or to apply for jobs and internships in the motion picture and television industries.

</div><h2>Geography</h2><p>Geography is the science of studying human and physical attributes on the surface of the Earth. These attributes may be marks of human occupation, properties of some natural environment, or both.  Geographers ask the questions "Where" and "Why there", with an interest in describing and explaining the various ways in which people have made Earth their home at scales ranging from the local to the global.  Geography is an integrative discipline whose interests in space and place and whose perspectives from both environmental and social sciences foster a greater understanding of the interrelationships between the human and physical worlds.  The use of Geo-Spatial Technologies, including Geographic Information Science (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), are now widely used in the visualization, measurement and analysis of Earth's physical features and human societies, as well as the interaction between them.</p><div id="GEOG-1" tabindex="-1">

</div><h2>Geology</h2><p>Geology is an interdisciplinary science that integrates the principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences to explore and understand the Earth. Geology asks and answers questions about the Earth, including its origins, composition, structure, and past and present activity and the impact of these factors on society. As a science with pragmatic applications it is also applied to locate resources and assess their abundance, to mitigate geologic hazards, and to provide critical information about Earth's changing climate and the impact of these changes on our ecosystems. A degree in geology can translate to a number of important and highly valued academic and professional positions, including but not limited to, Earth scientist (e.g. geologist, seismologist, volcanologist, oceanographer, soil scientist, hydrologist, etc.), environmental consultant, environmental lawyer, remediation specialist, climate scientist, and teacher.</p><div id="GEOL-1" tabindex="-1">

<p>This course is an introduction to the history of Earth and its evolution including surface environments, atmosphere, oceans, and life. Sedimentary rocks are studied for stratigraphic relationships, environmental indicators, and biologic significance to reconstruct the geological and biological evolution of Earth over time. Numerical methods, like geochronology, are also employed to assign absolute ages to past environments. The combination of both relative and numerical methods to the study of plate tectonics and geologic structures will allow the student to understand how Earth history is reconstructed. A particular emphasis is placed on the study of North American sequences.</p>

<h3>IXD 330, Interaction Design Studio 2 <span></span>3 units</h3>
<p class="preface">Transfer: CSU
</p><p class="preface">Prerequisite: Interaction Design 310.</p>
<p>Microinteractions, found in every user interface, are designed moments (e.g. log in, copy and paste, on or off) that are an integral part of every interface. This course reveals these seemingly invisible interactive controls, providing an overview of specific platforms, paradigms, and affordances. The studio prepares students to create task oriented end-to-end user experiences and interaction flows. Students learn how to design at the micro scale, exploring appropriate forms, states, feedback, and loops based on different contexts and user goals. Through iterative methodologies, students learn to refine the details of a specific feature interaction. Collaborating directly with users and fellow classmates, students prototype, critique, and test existing interaction examples and their own microinteraction designs. Students develop a critical understanding of how interactive forms communicate and influence a user's behavior.</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to the study of language. It provides an overview of the field of linguistics, its three dimensions of language structure: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), vocabulary (morphology), and grammar (syntax), and the way linguistic structure and context give rise to meaning (semantics and pragmatics). In addition the course considers how social practices are shaped by and shape language use, as well as how language is acquired and learned. The course provides a grounding in linguistics as a field of study, basic analytic skills for viewing and discussing language from a variety of perspectives, and greater awareness of the relevance of language across and within cultures.</p>

<h2>Media Studies</h2>
<p>Media is a versatile discipline consisting of two areas of study: media studies and media production.  Our media studies area focuses on the analysis of the mass media. Media Studies courses use an analytical and historical approach, and students develop skills to assess the role and impact of mass media on society. Students examine the history, values, and structure of media in the US and internationally. Media literacy skills are another fundamental component of Media Studies Courses. Upon successful completion of our Media Studies courses, each student should leave as a media literate individual - a more aware, critical audience member with a well-developed sense of mass media's role in society.  There is a wide range of employment possibilities for students trained in Media Studies, including positions in public relations, business, sales, public and personnel relations, and advertising.

Our Media Production courses provide hands-on training in the areas of Television, Radio and Internet Broadcasting, including broadcast news, sports, promotional videos, podcasting, short form and emerging media (360/virtual and augmented reality). Students completing the Broadcasting degrees and/or certificates are prepared for both employment opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs. The Promo Pathways program provides intensive training and internships for students pursuing promo advertising careers opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs.</p>

</div><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>Philosophy is a foundation of education in the liberal arts. Philosophy enriches thought, imagination, understanding, and experience. By studying philosophy, students confront questions and problems both theoretical and practical about themselves and their relation to the world.  Philosophy courses rigorously examine the basic assumptions of every human endeavorÂ¿from seeking knowledge to deciding what is right or wrong--thereby enriching studentsÂ¿ understanding of what it means to be human and preparing them to think critically for a lifetime.

Political science has four well-defined subfields: political theory, international relations, comparative politics, and American politics. Courses focus on topics and pressing problems, among them war, law, local, state, and national politics, voting, mass media, public opinion, poverty, human rights, race, gender, ideology, class, international organizations, revolutions, and failed states in all parts of the world.  Students in these courses learn to critically analyze not only the behavior of political actors, but also their respective political institutions and political systems. The main objectives are to enable students to use strong analytical skills and critical thinking in their analysis of theories, institutions, and processes.</p><div id="POL-SC-1" tabindex="-1">

<p class="preface">Prerequisite: None.</p>
<p>This course will focus on the theory and application of psychological principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a "universal human nature" and the modern environment results in an "evolutionary mismatch."  Evolutionary models such as the "tragedy of the commons" will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind's social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.</p>

</div><h2>Sociology</h2><p>Sociology is the study of social life. It seeks to understand all aspects of human social behavior, including the behavior of individuals as well as the social dynamics of small groups, large organizations, communities, institutions, and entire societies. Students of sociology study a broad array of topics including social networks, gender roles and relationships, family structure and behavior, interpersonal relationships and processes, urban development, historical societies, social movements, gang violence, current immigration issues, race and ethnic relations, and crime and incarceration. Sociology looks for what is universal as well as what varies across societies and groups and courses explore social change and provide a lens into the complexity of the causes and consequences of human behavior.</p><div id="SOCIOL-1" tabindex="-1">

</div><h2>Urban Studies</h2><p>Urban Studies is an interdisciplinary investigation of our dynamic world of cities and their suburbs.  From points of view ranging from the local to the global, students in this field examine cities as complex social groupings of people and institutions, as well as cultural landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Urban Studies is concerned with what cities are and have been, as well as with ever-changing ideas about what cities could and should be. Urban Studies prepares students for careers in fields such as urban planning, architecture, public policy, and real-estate development, and it informs discussions of issues such as housing, transportation, urban renewal, segregation, sustainability, and suburban sprawl.</p><div id="URBAN-8" tabindex="-1">
<h3>URBAN 8, Introduction to Urban Studies <span></span>3 units</h3>
<p class="preface">Transfer:  UC, CSU
</p><p class="preface">IGETC AREA 4 (Social and Behavioral Sciences)</p>
<p class="preface">Prerequisite:  None.</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the multi-disciplinary study of urban society and space. Cities are examined both as complex social-economic groupings of people, and as material landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</p>
<p>Urban Studies 8 is the same course as Geography 8.  Students may earn credit for one, but not both.</p>

</div><h2>Women'S, Gender and Sexuality Studies</h2><p>Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability, and other sources of inequalities. The students who enroll in these courses gain the opportunity to understand how social forces, organized around the central concept of gender, shape both themselves as individuals and the world around them. Students have the opportunity to attain a fuller understanding of human behavior, culture, and society made possible by investigating women's lives, as well as the lives of other marginalized groups, and acquaint themselves with the experience of subordinate genders of various economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.</p><div id="WGS-10" tabindex="-1">

<p class="preface">Formerly Women's Studies 80 and Women's Studies 8.
</p><p>This course is an application of feminist theories and women's, gender and sexuality studies pedagogy to leadership development. Utilizing the methods and tools found in the interdisciplinary field of women's, gender and sexuality studies, the course is rooted in theoretically-based and thoughtfully-organized individual and collective action through leadership training, group activities, service-learning, and networking opportunities both on and off campus. By emphasizing the importance of praxis--connecting theory and practice--students develop an understanding of a broad range of women's experiences across class, racial/ethnic, and international lines. Students initiate, design, and implement a "field project" of their choosing that demonstrates their understanding of feminist theories and praxis. Specific course content fluctuates based on individual and group interests, available resources, and community needs.</p>
