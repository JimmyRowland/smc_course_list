</div><h2>Biological Sciences</h2><p>Coursework and study in the biological sciences provides a foundation for future employment in many of the fastest growing and emerging STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields today. Students of biology are at the front lines of many of the most critical questions our society is facing in the 21st century and beyond, including addressing climate change, the biodiversity crisis, resource management and population growth, emerging/infectious diseases and public health. Students of biology become lab technicians, nurses, genetic counselors, physicians, environmental scientists, landscape architects, state and national park rangers, researchers in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, teachers and college professors. Logic and critical thinking skills developed as a student of biology are applicable to nearly every field and every discipline and provide a foundation for making informed personal, business and public policy decisions.

Students must be present for the first session of biological science classes to be assured of admission to limited laboratory spaces. Students who wish to enroll in a Life Sciences course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment.  Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better.  If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better.  Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.</p><div id="ANATMY-1" tabindex="-1">

<p>This course is an intensive study of the gross and microscopic structure of the human body including the four major types of tissue and their subgroups, and the following organ systems: integumentary, skeletal, muscular, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory.  Functions of the organ systems are included at the introductory level to prepare students for a course in Human Physiology.  Laboratory assignments develop the skills of observation, investigation, identification, discovery and dissection.  The use of actual specimens, including cat dissection and observation of a human cadaver, is emphasized to assure that students learn the relative structure, functions, textures and variations in tissues not incorporated in models.  Supplemental materials such as models, photographs, charts, videotapes, and digitized images are also provided.  This course is required for students preparing for many Allied Health professions including, but not limited to, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physical Education and Kinesiology Training, and Physician's Assistant and is a prerequisite for Human Physiology 3.</p>

They conduct a variety of experiments and tests in laboratories to develop new knowledge or maintain control over the quality of existing products and procedures. Chemists may work in research and development, or production and quality control in the chemical manufacturing industry, and in education or government institutions.

Students must be present at the first lab session of a chemistry course to be assured of admission to limited lab spaces.
Students who wish to enroll in a chemistry course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment.  Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better.  If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better.  Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.</p><div id="CHEM-9" tabindex="-1">

<h2>Esl - English As A Second Language</h2>
<p>English for Second Language Speakers courses are designed specifically for students whose first language is not English.  SMC offers three different ESL programs:  
1) Credit ESL courses focus on academic skills needed for success in college (reading textbooks, listening and notetaking, writing papers with citations, speaking in class in small groups, and making presentations).  Faculty assist students in the development of grammar, vocabulary, paraphrasing, and summarizing skills within the context of themes or academic content.  ESL 11B, 21A, and 21B are CSU and UC transferable (up to 8 units).   
2) Noncredit ESL courses focus on college and career readiness and developing the skills needed for life and work in the US.  Noncredit ESL courses are free to students, except those studying on an F-1 visa.  These courses do not carry any academic credit.
3) Intensive ESL (offered through SMC's Community Services Program in conjunction with International Education) offers multi-skills courses to prepare international students for entry to Santa Monica College.  Student work is graded, but courses in the Intensive ESL Program do not receive academic credit.  These courses are offered for a fee.</p>

<h2>Fashion Design and Merchandising</h2>
<p>Fashion design students develop skills in design communication, including preliminary sketching, technical flat sketching, illustration, and usage of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and CAD software. Skills in draping, pattern drafting from draping and body measurements, and basic sewing skills to advanced construction are developed in order to create sample garments for production and sales.

Fashion merchandisers select, purchase, promote, and sell clothing and accessories. They study fashion trends and visit manufacturers and merchandise markets. They work as part of a team and consult with managers and buyers,
advise the advertising and display departments, and organize and coordinate promotional activities such as fashion shows. They may advance to become buyers and purchasing agents, sales representatives, and managers. Clothes designers create new apparel and accessory designs. They may sketch the garment, cut the pattern, select the fabric and materials, and in some cases construct the sample garment. They may arrange for the showing of a line at sales meetings or fashion shows.</p>

<h2>Film Studies</h2>
<p>Film consists of two areas of concentration: Film Studies and Film Production.  Film Studies introduces students to the history and development of cinema/film as an art, an object of philosophical study, and a cultural and social phenomenon. Students examine the theoretical approaches and trends in filmmaking including the contemporary evolution from film to digital media. 

Film Production provides practical as well as theoretical training in screenwriting, directing, creative producing, cinematography, sound recording, production design, and below-the-line crafts (gaffers, grips, operators, assistants). Students learn all aspects of film production from an academic discipline to hands-on experience that prepares them to earn an Associate degree and/or certificate of achievement in film production; for upper division study at a four-year college or advanced film school; and/or to apply for jobs and internships in the motion picture and television industries.

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Geography is the science of studying human and physical attributes on the surface of the Earth. These attributes may be marks of human occupation, properties of some natural environment, or both.  Geographers ask the questions "Where" and "Why there", with an interest in describing and explaining the various ways in which people have made Earth their home at scales ranging from the local to the global.  Geography is an integrative discipline whose interests in space and place and whose perspectives from both environmental and social sciences foster a greater understanding of the interrelationships between the human and physical worlds.  The use of Geo-Spatial Technologies, including Geographic Information Science (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), are now widely used in the visualization, measurement and analysis of Earth's physical features and human societies, as well as the interaction between them.</p>

Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</p>
<p>Geography 8 is the same course as Urban Studies 8.  Students may earn credit for one, but not both.</p>

<h2>Geology</h2>
<p>Geology is an interdisciplinary science that integrates the principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences to explore and understand the Earth. Geology asks and answers questions about the Earth, including its origins, composition, structure, and past and present activity and the impact of these factors on society. As a science with pragmatic applications it is also applied to locate resources and assess their abundance, to mitigate geologic hazards, and to provide critical information about Earth's changing climate and the impact of these changes on our ecosystems. A degree in geology can translate to a number of important and highly valued academic and professional positions, including but not limited to, Earth scientist (e.g. geologist, seismologist, volcanologist, oceanographer, soil scientist, hydrologist, etc.), environmental consultant, environmental lawyer, remediation specialist, climate scientist, and teacher.</p>

<h2>Media Studies</h2>
<p>Media is a versatile discipline consisting of two areas of study: media studies and media production.  Our media studies area focuses on the analysis of the mass media. Media Studies courses use an analytical and historical approach, and students develop skills to assess the role and impact of mass media on society. Students examine the history, values, and structure of media in the US and internationally. Media literacy skills are another fundamental component of Media Studies Courses. Upon successful completion of our Media Studies courses, each student should leave as a media literate individual - a more aware, critical audience member with a well-developed sense of mass media's role in society.  There is a wide range of employment possibilities for students trained in Media Studies, including positions in public relations, business, sales, public and personnel relations, and advertising.

Our Media Production courses provide hands-on training in the areas of Television, Radio and Internet Broadcasting, including broadcast news, sports, promotional videos, podcasting, short form and emerging media (360/virtual and augmented reality). Students completing the Broadcasting degrees and/or certificates are prepared for both employment opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs. The Promo Pathways program provides intensive training and internships for students pursuing promo advertising careers opportunities in the broadcasting industry and transfer into four-year degree programs.</p>

<h2>Political Science</h2>
<p>Political science is the academic discipline dedicated to the study of power and justice.  Political science has four well-defined subfields: political theory, international relations, comparative politics, and American politics. Courses focus on topics and pressing problems, among them war, law, local, state, and national politics, voting, mass media, public opinion, poverty, human rights, race, gender, ideology, class, international organizations, revolutions, and failed states in all parts of the world.  Students in these courses learn to critically analyze not only the behavior of political actors, but also their respective political institutions and political systems. The main objectives are to enable students to use strong analytical skills and critical thinking in their analysis of theories, institutions, and processes.</p>

It seeks to understand all aspects of human social behavior, including the behavior of individuals as well as the social dynamics of small groups, large organizations, communities, institutions, and entire societies.

</div><h2>Urban Studies</h2><p>Urban Studies is an interdisciplinary investigation of our dynamic world of cities and their suburbs.  From points of view ranging from the local to the global, students in this field examine cities as complex social groupings of people and institutions, as well as cultural landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Urban Studies is concerned with what cities are and have been, as well as with ever-changing ideas about what cities could and should be. Urban Studies prepares students for careers in fields such as urban planning, architecture, public policy, and real-estate development, and it informs discussions of issues such as housing, transportation, urban renewal, segregation, sustainability, and suburban sprawl.</p><div id="URBAN-8" tabindex="-1">

<p class="preface">Prerequisite:  None.</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the multi-disciplinary study of urban society and space. Cities are examined both as complex social-economic groupings of people, and as material landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</p>
<p>Urban Studies 8 is the same course as Geography 8.  Students may earn credit for one, but not both.</p>

</div><h2>Women'S, Gender and Sexuality Studies</h2><p>Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry analyzing structures of power, especially as they are grounded in gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, ability, and other sources of inequalities. The students who enroll in these courses gain the opportunity to understand how social forces, organized around the central concept of gender, shape both themselves as individuals and the world around them. Students have the opportunity to attain a fuller understanding of human behavior, culture, and society made possible by investigating women's lives, as well as the lives of other marginalized groups, and acquaint themselves with the experience of subordinate genders of various economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.</p><div id="WOM-ST-10" tabindex="-1">

<p>Utilizing feminist theories and feminist analysis, this course examines the relationship between women and popular culture. Students will examine historical and contemporary images and roles of women in popular culture (including print, film, television, music, advertising, and consumerism) and situate these images and roles within changing socio-historical, political, and economic contexts.

The intersection of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation is examined throughout the course and the relationship between popular culture and feminist movements is emphasized.</p>
