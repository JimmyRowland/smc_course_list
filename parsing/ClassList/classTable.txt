<h2>Biological Sciences</h2>
<address>Students must be present for the first session of biological science classes to be assured of admission to limited laboratory spaces.
Students who wish to enroll in a Life Sciences course must demonstrate that they have met the prerequisites for the course prior to enrollment.  Continuing students must complete prerequisite courses with a C or better.  If currently enrolled in a prerequisite course at SMC at the time of enrollment, students will be admitted to subsequent courses based upon midterm placement results, but will be dropped if the prerequisite course is not completed with a C or better.  Students who have successfully completed one or more prerequisite courses (earning a grade of C- or better in both the lecture and lab courses and an average of C (2.0) or better overall) at another institution may be able to verify having met the prerequisites by submitting a transcript and course description and course syllabus for the prerequisite courses.

Some of the courses listed in this section are accompanied by Supplemental Instruction.  Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic assistance program that utilizes free peer-assisted weekly study sessions to help students learn the most difficult course content.

<address>This course is an intensive study of the gross and microscopic structure of the human body including the four major types of tissue and their subgroups, and the following organ systems: integumentary, skeletal, muscular, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory.  Functions of the organ systems are included at the introductory level to prepare students for a course in Human Physiology.  Laboratory assignments develop the skills of observation, investigation, identification, discovery and dissection.  The use of actual specimens, including cat dissection and observation of a human cadaver, is emphasized to assure that students learn the relative structure, functions, textures and variations in tissues not incorporated in models.  Supplemental materials such as models, photographs, charts, videotapes, and digitized images are also provided.  This course is required for students preparing for many Allied Health professions including, but not limited to, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physical Education and Kinesiology Training, and Physician's Assistant and is a prerequisite for Human Physiology 3.</address>

<address>The evolution of American food culture is examined from a historical, contemporary, economic, political and scientific survey of ethnic groups in America, including Native Americans, European Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Immigration, enculturation, acculturation, religion, food availability, food preference, food behavior, food preparation, food beliefs and food-related gender roles are considered. These factors are compared and contrasted across the ethnic groups and regions in America. The impact of "Americanization" on ethnic cuisines and impact of ethnic cuisines on the American economy are explored. Current research on the health- and nutrition-related implications of ethnic groups' food choices/practices is reviewed. Engendering cultural sensitivity and competency is at the core of this course.</address>

<address>This course studies the major characters and tales from the mythologies of several Asian societies. A sort of ur-knowledge or ur-science, mythology in Asian societies is both an attempt to understand the nature of the cosmos and a human being's place in it as well as a means of organizing relationships among people to form a cohesive, functioning society. The course takes a thematic approach to myths and legends from a variety of sources, especially literature and the visual arts, to examine humanity's attempt to explain the unknown and the meaning of life: the beginning of the world, creation of living creatures, explanation of natural phenomena, relationships between gods and mortals, deeds of super heroes, duties of an individual in a society, death, and afterlife. The resonance of these mythological motifs and characters in modern Asian cultures will also be studied.</address>

<address>This course will focus on the theory and application of psychological principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a ¿universal human nature¿ and the modern environment results in an ¿evolutionary mismatch.¿ Evolutionary models such as the ¿tragedy of the commons¿ will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind¿s social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.</address>

Cities are examined both as complex social-economic groupings of people, and as material landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</address>

<p></p>
<address>This course is an introduction to the study of language. It provides an overview of the field of linguistics, its three dimensions of language structure: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), vocabulary (morphology), and grammar (syntax), and the way linguistic structure and context give rise to meaning (semantics and pragmatics). In addition the course considers how social practices are shaped by and shape language use, as well as how language is acquired and learned. The course provides a grounding in linguistics as a field of study, basic analytic skills for viewing and discussing language from a variety of perspectives, and greater awareness of the relevance of language across and within cultures.</address>

<address>This course will focus on the theory and application of psychological principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a "universal human nature" and the modern environment results in an "evolutionary mismatch."  Evolutionary models such as the "tragedy of the commons" will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind's social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.</address>

Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</address>
