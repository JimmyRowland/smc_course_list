MTWTh"	MC 16	Harclerode J E	UC CSU	This course is an introduction to the study of language. It provides an overview of the field of linguistics, its three dimensions of language structure: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), vocabulary (morphology), and grammar (syntax), and the way linguistic structure and context give rise to meaning (semantics and pragmatics). In addition the course considers how social practices are shaped by and shape language use, as well as how language is acquired and learned. The course provides a grounding in linguistics as a field of study, basic analytic skills for viewing and discussing language from a variety of perspectives, and greater awareness of the relevance of language across and within cultures.

Students will learn about celestial motions and how these motions have shaped various cultural views, and how cultural beliefs and values shaped interpretations of the phenomena seen.  We will see how eclipses of the sun and moon helped mark important epochs of time, and how solar and lunar motions were used to help create calendars. The class will study the development of astronomy in western European cultures, American cultures (North America, Mesoamerica, and South America), and non-western cultures (Asia, Africa).

Utilizing the methods and tools found in the interdisciplinary field of women's, gender and sexuality studies, the course is rooted in theoretically-based and thoughtfully-organized individual and collective action through leadership training, group activities, service-learning, and networking opportunities both on and off campus. By emphasizing the importance of praxis--connecting theory and practice--students develop an understanding of a broad range of women's experiences across class, racial/ethnic, and international lines. Students initiate, design, and implement a ""field project"" of their choosing that demonstrates their understanding of feminist theories and praxis. Specific course content fluctuates based on individual and group interests, available resources, and community needs."	12:45p.m.-2:05p.m.	TTh	Spring 2019	3
